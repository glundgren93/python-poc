#To run tests

Currently the only way I managed to run the tests is with this command
```bash
    python -m pytest tests/
```

#To start
```bash
    python3 .\src\main.py
```

#Set up virtual environment
```bash
    python3 -m venv local   
    .\local\Scripts\activate
```

#Install dependencies
From virtual environment
```bash
    poetry install
```
